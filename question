Hi, sorry to reach out like this. I am a game designer and happened upon your Station project and am interested in your open modular approach. However, when examining the project in Unity, I can't seem to find the editor page in your screen shots. Instead I only find the demo scene. Would love if you could provide some guidance. Thanks!
